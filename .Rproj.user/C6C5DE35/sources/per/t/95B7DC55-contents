\title{A function to get word count corrected by tf_idf values}
\usage{
tds_process(text_count, segment_size = 100, training = FALSE,
  lemmatization = "none", no_number = TRUE, min_doc_count = 2,
  min_word_count = 0, max_word_set = 3000)
}
\arguments{
\item{text_count}{A tidy dataframe of textual data (typically the "long" format used by tidytext)}

\item{segment_size}{The standard size of a continuous segment of text (100 as a default). Remaining segments within a document will be discarded.}

\item{training}{Set to true if the output of the text process is to train a new model. The function will simply keep a "label" column that should exist.}

\item{lemmatization}{Use one of the five available languages for lemmatization: "english", "french", "german", "spanish" or "italian". Lemmatization is approximative but usually enhance the results (since inflected words can be more readily used)}

\item{no_number}{Set to true to remove all numbers from the dataset. This is usually recommended.}

\item{min_doc_count}{The minimum number of documents where a word should be present. It's useful to avoid over-fitting.}

\item{min_word_count}{The minimum number of occurrences of a word all documents considered.}

\item{max_word_set}{The maximum number of word to keep (3000 as a default). Massive matrix becomes harder to process for little gain.}
}
\value{
A processed version of the textual dataset using tf_idf values with cosine normalization.
